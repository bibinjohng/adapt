      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#1181c3] mb-4">Eligibility for SDA</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        To access SDA funding, an individual must be assessed as having significant and complex disability-related needs that require specialized housing. The NDIS determines eligibility based on functional assessments and personal circumstances, and the funding covers the cost of housing and the additional supports needed for a participant to live in an SDA home.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        SDA homes are a vital component of the NDIS, helping to improve the independence and quality of life for individuals with disabilities, while also providing a safe and supportive environment. 
      </p>
      <p class=" underline italic">Adapt smarthomes helps individuals to live in SDA properties that can maintain a high quality of life, with access to necessary care and support while promoting independence and inclusion.</p>
